<h2 id="what-is-ecs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#what-is-ecs">§</a>What is ECS?</h2>
<p>ECS is a data-oriented programming paradigm that focuses on optimizing the CPU cache.
Objects (“Entities”) store their data in “Components”,
which are processed in “Systems”.</p>
<h2 id="dynec-has-e-c-and-s-but-it-is-not-the-typical-ecs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#dynec-has-e-c-and-s-but-it-is-not-the-typical-ecs">§</a>dynec has E, C and S, but it is not the typical ECS</h2>
<p>dynec is <strong>statically archetyped</strong>.
The archetype of an entity refers to the set of components it can have,
which is comparable to the <em>class</em> of an object in OOP.
In dynec, entities cannot change to another archetype once created.
Entities can still have optional components, but they must be known in advance.</p>
<p>This allows entity references to be strictly typed.
When you hold an entity reference,
you are assured that all entities in the reference are present.
Entities of different archetypes are stored separately,
which further improves <em>cache locality</em>
(since components of different archetypes are mostly unrelated).
Components can also declare that they must always be present on entities of an archetype,
which give you more confidence that the component really exists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, archetypes cannot be subtyped.
This means that, unlike the traditional ECS,
there is no “join query” that queries all entities with a subset of components present.
Iteration can only be performed on all entities of an archetype
(it is also possible to iterate over all entities with a single component,
but this is for a different purpose).
If you want to fetch all entities with all of multiple components
like how you would usually do in other frameworks,
you probably wanted to split them to be a separate entity instead.</p>
<h3 id="doesnt-this-make-polymorphism-more-difficult-to-use"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#doesnt-this-make-polymorphism-more-difficult-to-use">§</a>Doesn’t this make polymorphism more difficult to use?</h3>
<p>I imagine your design is like this:
some entities have the “pig” archetype,
some have the “bird” archetype,
both share the common animal components,
while “bird” also has the additional flight- and egg-related components.</p>
<p>This is not the perspective to organize entities in dynec.
Pigs and birds are both the same archetype, let’s say “animal”.
The term “bird” is just an umbrella term to refer to abilities such as flying and laying eggs.
It should not be a concept that appears in the code logic at all,
because “bird” does not really mean anything at the programming level.
In a sense, entities in dynec are comparable to some optional components in traditional ECS.</p>
<p>This implies entities would have a lot of references among them —
a bird entity needs to reference its flight management entity and egg-laying entity.
Although this seems to complicate the design a lot,
this is actually inevitable in high-quality software
where one-to-one relationship is probably rare compared to one-to-many relationship.
For example, a bird may lay multiple types of eggs,
which would result in multiple egg-laying entities;
this cannot be trivially managed anyway.</p>
<h2 id="entities-are-optionally-reference-counted-and-trackable"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#entities-are-optionally-reference-counted-and-trackable">§</a>Entities are (optionally) reference-counted and trackable</h2>
<p>When debug assertions are enabled, all entity references are counted.
When an entity is deleted, dynec panics if there are still dangling references to the entity
and searches for the dangling references from all components and states in the world.
This means we can be (mostly) confident that any entity reference points to a live one,
and enables reduction of the size of a strong entity reference to one integer
because strong reference should not be able to outlive the referenced entity
(most ECS frameworks require another integer to store the “generation”
to avoid dangling references from pointing to a new entity recreated at the same offset).</p>
<p>Dropping all references before an entity is deleted sounds troublesome to implement,
but dynec provides two solutions for this.
First, dynec supports “finalizer components”,
where components serve as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/">asynchronous finalizers</a>.
Systems can create finalizers that ensure that references to the entity are dropped
before the actual deletion (and the dangling reference check) takes place.
This gives different systems the chance to clean up an entity
without losing the context that describes the entity
(because components are dropped after deletion and cannot be read anymore).
Second, if it is really necessary to retain the (dangling) entity reference,
you can store a “weak reference” instead —
weak references are also reference-counted, but they do not cause a dangling reference panic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to track where entities are located,
all components and global and system-local states (basically all storages managed by dynec)
must implement a trait that supports scanning all owned strong/weak entity references.
dynec provides a derive macro to achieve this,
but since Rust does not support specialization (yet),
an <code>#[entity]</code> attribute needs to be applied on every field that may reference entities.
However, with the use of static assertions,
most mistakes in implementing the trait can be revealed at compile time
(exceptions are types with generic parameters, which require manual confirmation).
Despite all the trouble, the ability to scan for entity references make more features feasible,
including automatic system dependency declaration and entity rearrangement (described below).</p>
<h2 id="entities-can-have-multiple-components-of-the-same-type"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#entities-can-have-multiple-components-of-the-same-type">§</a>Entities can have multiple components of the same type</h2>
<p>How would we store the health of a player?
We create a <code>Health</code> component for player entities.
What if we also want to store the hunger of a player?
OK, we also add a <code>Hunger</code> component for player entities.
Now, what if we have an unknown number of such attributes,
determined at runtime (e.g. by plugins or an authoritative game server)?
Since we cannot declare types dynamically, it seems we have to refactor into a map or a Vec.
Or maybe a <code>SmallVec&lt;[Attribute; N]&gt;</code> to avoid heap allocation.
Wait, how much is <code>N</code>?</p>
<p>In dynec, we avoid this problem with “isotope components”.
Similar to isotopes in chemistry,
there may be multiple components of the same type (<code>Attribute</code>) for the same entity,
but these components belong to different “discriminants” (e.g. the attribute ID).
So in terms of semantics, it looks as if we got a <code>HashMap&lt;AttributeId, Attribute&gt;</code> component,
but in terms of performance, each <code>AttributeId</code> gets allocated in a new storage
as if it is a different component.
This design is also more efficient in the example here,
because some systems may only want to manipulate health but not hunger,
so it should be able to execute concurrently with systems that use the hunger attribute;
it is also better for cache locality since it avoids striding attributes with unused values.
This is not possible in ECS frameworks that only support type-based component key,
which lack flexibility for dynamically defined logic.</p>
<h2 id="entities-can-be-rearranged-to-optimize-random-access-not-yet-implemented"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#entities-can-be-rearranged-to-optimize-random-access-not-yet-implemented">§</a>Entities can be rearranged to optimize random access (not yet implemented)</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why ECS performs better than traditional OOP-based code style
is that components are stored in a compact region instead of scattered around the heap,
reducing the frequency of CPU cache penetration that causes slow memory access.
However, when the amount of data is large,
since entities are typically randomly arranged (no less random than heap allocation),
systems may need to access components from entities arranged far apart.
For example, in the case of iterating over all edges in a network simulation
(where nodes and edges are entities, and edges have components referencing the endpoint nodes),
although the data describing the edge itself are contiguously arranged,
accessing the data for the endpoint nodes would lead to random memory access,
greatly deterriorating the performance.</p>
<p>In dynec, since all entity references are trackable,
it is possible to permute all entities of the same archetype
so that relevant entities are located more closely.
For example, in the case of a spatial graph
(where edge length is comparable to node density, i.e. very few super-long edges),
we can perform an quadtree/octree sort on all nodes and edges such that
iterating over all edge entities would process spatially nearby edges,
which in turn accesses spatially nearby nodes,
both of which have higher chance of getting nearby memory allocation.</p>
<p>Of course, entity rearrangement is only useful for scenarios
where the ideal entity arrangement can be retained for a long period.
For example, it is useful to rearrange buildings on a map because they are mostly stationary,
but it is not useful to rearrange cars travelling on the map since their order quickly changes
(unless cars have very slow speed or move in a similar direction as nearby cars).
Since entity rearrangement requires mutable access to all component storages for an archetype
and processes a lot of data at the same time,
this is a stop-the-world operation that must not be performed frequently,
so the period for which the arrangement drifts away (such that rearrangement is necessary)
should be negligibly long such that user experience is not affected.</p>
